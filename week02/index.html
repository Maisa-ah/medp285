            <br>unholstered in <em>worn</em> black leather, 
            <br>with <a href= "#shelf">cherrywood bookcases</a> on either side,

            Georges Perec <br>lists out many objects <br>that are unfamiliar to someone <br>like me nowadays.
            The way the <br>chapter is structured shows him creating a setting for his characters.
            However, given that he doesn’t create his characters by giving them personality, it
            feels as if anyone could fit with these objects. I believe this feels more nostalgic,
            as if he’s describing his own memories rather than creating one for these unknown characters.

            Once again, we see implications of nostalgia and as though someone is remembering something. 
            The way it’s phrased is in third person but could very well potentially be the author reminiscing about his summer days.
