            Georges Perec lists out many objects that are unfamiliar to someone like me nowadays.
            The way the chapter is structured shows him creating a setting for his characters.
            However, given that he doesn’t create his characters by giving them personality, it
            feels as if anyone could fit with these objects. I believe this feels more nostalgic,
            as if he’s describing his own memories rather than creating one for these unknown characters.
